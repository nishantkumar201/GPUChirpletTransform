# Adaptive Chirplet Transform (ACT) – CPU & GPU Reference Implementations

## Overview

This repository provides CPU and GPU reference implementations of the Adaptive Chirplet Transform (ACT).

It includes:
- A CPU reference implementation (act.py) for correctness verification and reproducibility
- A GPU-accelerated implementation (act_gpu.py) leveraging **NVIDIA CUDA (via [CuPy](https://cupy.dev))** to accelerate dictionary generation and iterative decomposition

Both implementations include mathematically corrected normalization and expanded evaluation support, ensuring numerical consistency across backends.

The codebase is intended for:
- Reproducible ACT research
- Performance comparison between CPU and GPU pipelines

The GPU implementation has been previously validated and published in a conference setting. The CPU implementation has been updated to match the corrected mathematical formulation used in the GPU version. Optional CPU/GPU monitoring utilities are included to record power, memory, and utilization metrics.

This implementation is based on the original CPU code by [amanb2000](https://github.com/amanb2000/Adaptive_Chirplet_Transform).

## Repository Structure
The repository currently includes four core modules:

- **`act.py`**- Implements the mathematically correct Adaptive Chirplet Transform
- **`act_gpu.py`** – Implements the Adaptive Chirplet Transform including GPU-accelerated dictionary generation and signal decomposition. 
- **`monitoringclass.py`** – Provides CPU/GPU usage monitoring (power, memory, utilization), logging results to CSV for later inspection.  
- **`run_act_example.py`** – Example pipeline for loading EEG data, preprocessing, applying ACT, and exporting results.  

---
## Features

- CPU reference implementation (act.py) for correctness verification and reproducibility
- GPU-accelerated chirplet dictionary construction using CuPy (act_gpu.py)
- Iterative ACT decomposition with parameter refinement via SciPy optimization  
- EEG preprocessing supported through [MNE](https://mne.tools/)  
- Optional CPU/GPU monitoring during runs  
- Outputs results (parameters, coefficients, reconstruction errors) as CSV  

---

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.9+  
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (tested with CUDA 12.x) (if doing act_gpu.py)
- Recommended: 8 GB+ VRAM for larger EEG datasets (if doing act_gpu.py)

### Python Dependencies
All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
Install them with:
~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick Start

This guide will help you set up and run the provided code examples quickly.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
~~~

### 2.	Prepare EEG data
Place .edf EEG files in the expected directory structure.
Example path used in run_act_example.py:

~~~
ACT/Bitbrain/sub-1/eeg/sub-1_task-Sleep_acq-headband_eeg.edf
~~~

### 3. Run the example script

~~~
python run_act_example.py
~~~

### 	4.	Check outputs
Result Logs:
~~~
act_results_sub-1_optimized.csv
~~~
Monitoring logs:
~~~

gpu_monitoring.csv
~~~

## Output Format

The output CSV contains:

| Epoch | Params (tc, fc, logDt, c) | Coeffs | Error | Residue |
|-------|----------------------------|--------|-------|---------|
